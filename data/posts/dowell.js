            I landed a job to build this lively, bold thing -- an animated landing page for an IT consulting agency. Sadly the company didn't take off.

            I went with vanilla js & pug for repeating elements cause I decided you don't have to cram a SPA framework everywhere, right? )

            It has a growing circle, which paints over the background, lots of color-changing SVGs, an accordion, .gifs which are actually .webms to save space... Lots of stuff. You better check out the video.

            Besides all the animations, it also had an express.js server for collecting leads into Telegram, instead of usual emails.
