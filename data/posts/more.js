        I once did a landing page for Aviasales' premium subscription service called More. It had GSAP ScrollTrigger tied to various 3D animations pre-rendered into the new-ish .webm format, which is way cooler than the standard .mp4 cause it allows for transparency and also is more compact.

        So yeah, I was pretty happy with it, but it's been scrapped since, because it obviously required some time to load and, in the end, it was detrimental to conversion metrics.

        Still, it's my pride and joy.

        There was also an animation of typing and un-typing of a speech bubble text depending on scroll direction. And some video fragments were looped to compensate for variable content height.
