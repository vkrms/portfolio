            I have built a custom Wordpress theme based on the Sage boilerplate, which brings in modern coding practices, making wp theme development resemble working with a cool modern framework like Laravel. It uses the Blade template engine. Frontend is built with Webpack and vanilla JS.
            Notice the plane animation in the hero section. I'ts moving with the power of  an &lt;animateMotion> tag alone! No JavaScript, no CSS.
